# youtube-mp3-downloader
Just an app which uses the browser to download youtube videos as mp3 files, The app uses socket.io to relay what is downloading and when it is completed back to the browser

This is just a personal project as I needed to download audio from youtube but got fed up of all the relentless popups the online services have to offer.
As it is just for myself there isn't much in the way of error handling so if it's used wrong its probably likely to crash.
